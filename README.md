# Code-For-Cause

#### There are organizations and volunteers around the world who are on a pursuit to serve underprivileged members of the society, in all possible ways. One of the most rudimentary and important entities of a human being is Food. Organizations like Food banks, kitchen soups, shelter homes, community churches etc. are striving to serve the needy at their best. But only few organizations can afford to have system to manage their activities. In this project we are trying to develop a system that allows different organizations to communicate and serve various communities in the best possible way.

## Project Goals

• To develop a system that allows different organizations that will come together and serve a large underprivileged populace in most effective way. <br />
• To provide smaller kitchen soups to have their own work area to maintain their essential data. <br />
• To allow soup kitchens and the food banks to have an effective communication by leveraging workflows. <br />
• To connect food pantries to a larger network of resources. <br />
• To use data accumulated from the entire system to understand the trends. <br />

## Problem Statement

• Food pantries and food banks have very limited effective communication due to lack of a sophisticated system <br />
• Food pantries rely on limited resources from government and local service agencies that makes difficult to maintain continuous supply to the pantry <br />
• Food pantries do not have any resources to connect to them to health care organizations to have health screening for their community <br />
• Food pantries stock shelf-stable food (including canned, boxed and other processed foods), they often struggle to meet the nutritional needs of their clients <br />
• Food pantries rely on donations to stock their shelves – but often, those donations are low quality or culturally inappropriate <br />

## Solution

• We have designed a system that allows Food Banks, Hospitals, and Food Pantries to communicate effectively to monitor food insecurity and health issues in a community <br />
• In this system, we have brought three different entities into the ecosystem model to establish hierarchy and leveraged workflows as a means for effective communication <br />
• Now, food pantries can communicate directly with doctors and nutritionists to put a check on the community health problems <br />

## Conclusion

• We believe that adopting a well connected organization serves the poor community well. <br />
• Also, safer and cost-effective healthcare can be provided to patients. <br />
• Keeping track of inventory across multiple enterprises helps in faster delivery of food from food bank to food pantry. <br />
